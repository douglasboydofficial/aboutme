                Hi everyone! My name is Douglas Boyd and I am majoring in computer science. I just recently<br>
            decided on cybersecurity as my emphasis. I currently work as a data sync specialist remotely<br>
            for Conservice (company based out of Logan,Utah). It's mundane work but it pays the bills.
        </p>  
        <p>
                I am from Southern California (Arcadia if you know the area), but currently living in Boise, <br>
            Idaho with my wife. We don't have kids yet but are trying to start a family. My wife and I have<br>
            been married for just over 2 years.
        </p>   
        <p>
            
            I served my mission in the Indianapolis mission, mainly in 2019, and loved it. My main hobbbies <br>
            include hiking camping, cooking, and water sports (so kayaking, whitewater rafting, swimming, etc).<br>
            I love the world of forensics, so digital forensics is probably what I'm looking for career wise.<br>
            That, or any career that involves taking down scammers (I love scambaiting). My favorite scripture<br>
            is 2 Nephi 4:17-21.
